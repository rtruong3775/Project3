<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 - Group #43 </h1>
IGN (Imagine Games Network) is one of the most widely read news and game review sites in the industry, with many people relying on their reviews to chose a game. However, the quality of these critiques varies significantly from year to year and reviewer to reviewer. So the problem we are trying to solve is how can we identify the top-reviewed games in their catalog? Our intent is to examine the review data from IGN and develop a system that lets users search and filter reviews according to different criteria, ultimately identifying the top-rated games.
